# Happy_Walking_Tour_App
🎯Project Goal
The primary objective of this application is to strengthen my C++ development skills using the Qt framework. After completing the desktop prototype, I plan to explore implementing it as a web or mobile application.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 🗺️ Project Description
This project aims to create an interactive tour creation app, where users can:

Create a path with multiple stops

At each stop, add:

- 📷 Images

- 🔊 Audio

- 📍 A Google Maps link

Navigate from one stop to the next like slideshow slides, forming a seamless tour experience

To be considered feature-complete, the app must:

- Allow creation and editing of tours

- Display stops in a connected sequence

- Support media (images/audio) and external links

- Offer smooth navigation between stops
